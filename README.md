Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- Provided a filter UI that allows users to filter movies by genre.
- Displayed a list of movies sorted in descending order of popularity.
- Show the movie title, image, genre, cast, director, and a short description related
 to the movie in each information card.
- Implement smooth scrolling behavior to load more movies as the user scrolls in
 any direction i.e load movies of previous year when user scrolls up and load
 movies of next year when user scrolls down until the current year.
- Implemented a search bar which searches for the movie based on the search string
 and displays an infinite loading list of movies which matches the search.
